# Elastic Beanstalk

#### *Elastic Beanstalk* is a developer centric view of deploying application on AWS.
- A managed service
  - Instance configuration
  - OS is handled by Beanstalk
  - Deployment strategy is configurableut performed by Beanstalk
  - Application code configurable
- It will leverage all the AWS components that we have gone over thus far:
  - EC2
  - ASG
  - ELB
  - RDS
  - Etc..
- Elastic Beanstalk is free but you pay for the underlying instances
- Three architecture models:
  - Single instance deployment: good for developers
  - LB + ASG: great for production or staging web applications
  - ASG only: great for non-web apps in production
- Elastic Beanstalk has three components:
  - Application
  - Application Version (Each deployment gets assigned a version)
  - Environment name (dev, staging, prod): free naming
- You deploy application versions to environments and can promote application versions to the next environment
- Rollback feature to previous application versions
- Full control over the lifecycle of environments
- Support for many platforms:
  - Go
  - Java
  - Python
  - Node.js
  - Ruby
  - Single Container Docker
  - Multi Container Docker
  - Preconfigure Docker
  - Write your own custom platforms (If the any of the above is not supported)

#### Elastic Beanstalk Deployment Modes
- Single Instance mode: Great for development environment
- High Availability with Load Balancer mode: Great for production environments

What if you want to update each deployment
- **All at once (deploy on the go)**
  - Fastest, but instances aren't available to serve traffic for awhile (longer downtime)
  - No additional cost
- **Rolling update**
  - update a few (bucket) instances at a time, and then move onto the next bucket when the current ones become healthy
  - You can set the bucket size
  - Application will run below capacity during update
  - At some point, the application will run both versions simultaneously
  - Can be a very long deployment time depending on number of instances running
  - No additional cost
- **Rolling update with additonal batches**
  - Similar to rolling updates but you spin up new instances to move the batch (so the old application is still available)
  - Application is running at capacity
  - You can set the bucket size
  - Additional batches are removed at the end of the deployment
  - Small additional cost (due to additional running instances)
  - Great for production environments
- **Immutable**
  - Spins up new instances in a new ASG, deploys versions to these instances and then swaps all the instances when everything is healthy
  - Zero downtime
  - New code is deployed on new instances in a temporary ASG
  - High cost, double capacity
  - Longest deployment
  - Quick rollback in case of failures (new ASG will be terminated)
  - Best for production environements

#### Deployment Mechanism
- Describe dependancies
  - (requirements.txt for python, package.json for node.js)
- Package code as zip
- Zip file is uploaded to each EC2 machine
- Each EC2 machine resolves dependencies (SLOW)
- Optimization in case of long deployments:
  - Package dependencies with source code to improve deployment performance and speed

#### Blue / Green Deployment
- This is not a direct feature of Elastic Beanstalk
- Zero downtime and release facility
- Create a new staging environment and deploy your newest version there
- The new environment (green) can be validated independently and roll back if there's issues
- Route 53 can be setup using weighted policies to redirect a little bit of traffic to the staging environment
- Using the elastic beanstalk console, you can "swap URLs" when with the testing environment
- This is a manual feature, it's not directly embedded in EB

#### Elastic Beanstalk Extensions
- A zip file containing our code must be deployed to Elastic Beanstalk
- All the parameters set in the UI can be configured with code using files
- Requirements:
  - in the .ebextensions/ directory in the root of source code
  - YAML / JSON format
  - .config extensions (example: logging.config)
  - Able to modify some default settings using: option_settings
  - Ability to add resources such as RDS, ElastiCache, DynamoDB, etc...
- Resources managed by .ebextensions get deleted if the environment goes away
- The .ebextensions folder goes to the root of your project

#### Elastic Beanstalk CLI
- We can install an additional CLI called the “EB cli” which makes working with Beanstalk from the CLI easier
- Basic commands are:
  - eb create
  - eb status
  - eb health
  - eb events
  - eb logs
  - eb open
  - eb deploy
  - eb config
  - eb terminate
- It’s helpful for your automated deployment pipelines!
